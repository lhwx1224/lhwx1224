👋 Hi, I’m Hewenxuan Li, you are also welcomed to call me Vincent.
I am currently a post-doctoral researcher in laboratory of intelligent sensing and control (LISC) at Cornell University with a research focus on
- perception, flight dynamics, and control of insect-like robots
- data-driven actuation model identification for insect flights
- underwater target recognition and autonomous navigation

Prior to my post-doctoral study, I was a PhD student at the University of Rhode Island, focused on
- experimental investigation of damage evolution mechanism in nonlinear systems and 3D-printed materials
- fatigue damage modeling and prognosis in nonlinear systems
- data-driven modal analysis of mechanical systems

👀 I’m interested in the study of:
- system/damage intercation under the engineering fatigue context; 
- nonlinear dynamics in mechanical and electrical systems (mechanical/electrical oscillators);
- Data-driven modeling of the above mentioned system using nonlinear time series analysis and machine learning.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on deep learning and its application in damage prognosis under complex loading setup/ complex systems.
