- 👋 Hi, I’m Hewenxuan Li, you are also welcomed to call me Vincent. 
- 👀 I’m interested in the study of:
        system/damage intercation under the engineering fatigue context; 
        nonlinear dynamics in mechanical and electrical systems (mechanical/electrical oscillators);
        Data-driven modeling of the above mentioned system using nonlinear time series analysis and machine learning.
- 🌱 I’m currently a postdoc at LISC, Cornell, focusing on intelligent perception and control for flying robots and underwater navigation.
     other research interests involve modal identification, pattern recognition, and their applications in complex systems.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on deep learning and its application in damage prognosis under complex loading setup/ complex systems.
